# Arduino-PWM-receiver
This project is basically to read and write the signal values from any PWM compatible receiver. 
I have used Hi-tech Aurora 9 TRx in this project but any PWM compactable receiver can be used.
In general, the PWM values will be between 1000-2000. 
Both the codes used for read and write codes are uploaded.
The write code is written only for one channel. If required you can just add new inputs and copy the same code.
